# Gutter â€“ A declarative UI framework on top of Gio

Gutter is a declarative and reactive UI framework that is heavily inspired by Flutter, but aims to present an
idiomatic Go API. That is, it is not a clone.

## Current status

The project is currently in the prototyping stage.

## Audience

This framework is primarily for me and generally doesn't support things I don't need. In particular there are
no plans to support functionality that is specific to mobile devices, or input devices other than keyboards,
mice, and touchpads.
